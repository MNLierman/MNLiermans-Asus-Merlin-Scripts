### License Pertaining Soley to @MNLierman's (X [@MikeLierman](https://x.com/MikeLierman)) Router, Asus, and Merlin Scripts
You are free to redistribute, modify, change, improve, and include the scripts I've shared in this repo. My only requests are that you share any improvements you make and credit me.

This simple license does not pertain to anything else other than what is specifically stated here. I have several repos and many other projects which carry different licenses and requests. This license specifically pertains to my scripts for flashing, scripts for routers, and scripts for Asus/Merlin.

### Disclaimer
**Disclaimer: Use at your own risk! I may have put a lot of effort and time into what I've shared, but if my scripts turn your router into a molten heap of plastic, thatâ€™s on you. I provide these scripts with zero warranties or promises. Proceed with caution and a fire extinguisher nearby! ðŸ§¯**
